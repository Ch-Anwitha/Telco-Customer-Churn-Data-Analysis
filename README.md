# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis

## 🔍 Project Overview

Customer churn refers to customers who stop using a company’s service. Retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones, making churn analysis a critical task for businesses.

In this project, we perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and basic analysis on a telecom customer dataset to understand **patterns and factors influencing customer churn**. The insights from this analysis can help businesses take proactive steps to reduce churn.
