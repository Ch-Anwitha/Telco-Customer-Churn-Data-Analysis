# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis

## 🔍 Project Overview

Customer churn refers to customers who stop using a company’s service. Retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones, making churn analysis a critical task for businesses.

In this project, we perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and basic analysis on a telecom customer dataset to understand **patterns and factors influencing customer churn**. The insights from this analysis can help businesses take proactive steps to reduce churn.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Understand the structure and quality of the dataset
* Check for missing values and data consistency
* Analyze churn distribution across different customer attributes
* Visualize relationships between churn and demographic/service features
* Generate business-friendly insights using data visualization

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

### Programming Language

* **Python 3.11**

### Libraries

* **Pandas** – data manipulation and analysis
* **NumPy** – numerical computations
* **Matplotlib** – basic data visualization
* **Seaborn** – advanced and statistical visualizations
* **Jupyter Notebook** – interactive analysis environment

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed

* Missing value analysis (confirmed zero missing values)
* Distribution of churned vs non-churned customers
* Churn analysis based on:

  * Senior Citizen status
  * Gender
  * Contract type
  * Payment method
  * Internet and phone services
* Visual insights using count plots and comparative charts

---

## 📈 Sample Visualization

Example visualization included in the project:

* **Churn by Senior Citizen** – compares churn behavior between senior and non-senior customers

These visualizations help in identifying high-risk customer groups.

---

## ✅ Key Findings

* Dataset is clean with **no missing values**
* Certain customer segments show higher churn tendencies
* Visual analysis helps clearly identify churn patterns across features
